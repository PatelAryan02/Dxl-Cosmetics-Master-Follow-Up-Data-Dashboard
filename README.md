- It shows every task, its priority, who assigned it, who’s responsible, and how many follow-ups have been done.
- The design focuses on quick navigation, clean visuals, and giving management a real-time view of progress and delays.

## ✅ The Solution

- Added visual indicators for **priority, category, days, and follow-up rounds**.
- Created a clean filter panel for faster slicing and deeper insights.
- Made accountability simple by showing who assigned, who is responsible, and current status at a glance.
